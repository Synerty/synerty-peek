v3.4.x Release Notes
====================

Platform Changes
----------------

This release contains a major redevelopment for the offline capabilities
of Peek.

There are significant performance and memory improvements to the vortex
libraries and all plugins containing data indexes.

Major Plugin Changes
--------------------

Introduction of the Diagram PDF Exporter plugin.

v3.4.0 introduces PDF export support for the DMS Network Diagram. This allows
either the visible network or trace context to be exported as a PDF document
which the user can then download. When the Trace Export is selected, the
area of the network which contains the trace is exported. Alternatively,
when Visible Network is selected, the area of the network visible to the
user will be the area exported. Page size, orientation, and maximum pages can
be set to customise the PDF.

v3.4.0 introduces Light Mode, this feature replaces the background of the
network diagram with a white background and inverts only the colours
necessary to be visible on a white background. The initial migration
automatically detects and populates the light mode colours. The colours can
be manually updated if required. Simply clicking the button in the network
diagram will enable light mode, increasing the
readability of the network diagram if required.

Deployment Changes
------------------

There are no deployment changes with this release.

Windows Deployment
``````````````````

.. note:: This release is not supported on Windows.

Windows support might be possible in Peek version 4, however it will have 
a higher purchase and support cost to the customer.

Linux Deployment
````````````````

Deployment for Linux remains the same after the  changes of Peek v3.1.x

Debian: :ref:`debian_install_prerequisites`

Redhat: :ref:`rhel_install_prerequisites`

macOS Deployment
````````````````

Deployment for macOS remains the same after the major changes of Peek v3.1.x

MacOS: :ref:`macos_install_prerequisites`


Windows Deployment
``````````````````

Nil.

.. note:: The windows deployment will change to use Windows Subsystem for Linux
          in a future release.

Migration Steps
---------------

OpenStreetMap Loader Lookups File Migration
``````````````````````````````````````

#. Locate the **lookups.csv** file. The file location can be found in the
   configuration tab of the OpenStreetMap Loader Loader in Peek Admin.
#. Open the **lookups.csv** with a spreadsheet editor. Eg. Microsoft Excel
#. Remove :code:`Point` from the **acceptedGeometries** where **isRoadName** =
   :code:`TRUE`. Eg. :code:`LineString, Point` becomes :code:`Linestring`
#. Duplicate all rows where **isRoadName** = :code:`TRUE`.
#. In the original rows; Update the **option.isRoadName** to :code:`FALSE`.
#. In the new duplicated rows:

    #. Append the **importHash** value with :code:`_road_name`. Eg.
       :code:`osm:highways:motorway1` becomes
       :code:`osm:highways:motorway1_road_name`
    #. Increment the **level.order** value by :code:`1`.
#. **Restart** Peek Agent :code:`sudo systemctl restart peek_agent`
#. **Touch** the geojson file. The file location can be found in the
   configuration tab of the OpenStreetMap Loader Loader in Peek Admin. ::

        touch [GEOJSON FILE NAME]


.. note:: Synerty recommends running the Initial Load Attune Blueprint for
    faster loading of the PowerOn data.

Improvement
```````````

 * [PEEK-2237] - OpenStreetMap Loader - Added fill colour for water
   to default CSV Lookups file 

 * [PEEK-2253] - OpenStreetMap Loader - Loader now accepts null value colours in lookup.csv

 * [PEEK-2244] - OpenStreetMap Loader - Added support for importing road names
   separately to the polylines from the CSV file. This allows road names to be different
   levels, layers and colours to the roads.

 * [PEEK-2268] - OpenStreetMap Loader - Added support for search indexing map
   feature names

 * [PEEK-2257] - Diagram Editor - Improved polylines drawing support in diagram

   The grids are now loaded from the center of the screen outwards.
   See if you can notice the diffence.

 * [PEEK-2273] - Diagram - As the diagram zoomed in and out, the diagram would flicker black
   when the layer/sizes of grids changed. The flicking black is now gone.
   This is achieved by delaying applying the declutter levels to the old grids
   until the renderer has received the center grid for the new set of grids.

 * [PEEK-2274] - Diagram - Improved performance when rendering curved
   text
